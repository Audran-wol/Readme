# Readme
In this project, we will use Python language to send emails. We will use a few libraries, such as smtplib, MIMEMultipart and MIMEText, to enable the program to send emails. The program will enable the user to send emails through their email address with just the necessary credentials such as their email address, password, recipient's address and the message they want to send.

The program will first ask the user to enter the necessary credentials to send the email. Next, the credentials will be verified using smtplib. If the credentials are correct, the program will proceed to ask the user for the recipient's email address and the message they want to send. The program will then use MIMEMultipart and MIMEText to create an email with the specified content and the user's email address as the sender. Finally, the program will use smtplib to send the email.

This project will help the user quickly send emails from their own address without needing to log in to their email account or manually create an email.
Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a script to automate the process of sending emails using python. The script should take the recipient's email address, subject and body of the email as inputs and send an email with the given data.

Requirements:

• A text editor (for example, Sublime Text Editor) • Python 3 • SMTP library

Steps:

Create a new file in the text editor.
Import the SMTP library.
Assign the sender’s email address and the SMTP server address to variables.
Establish a connection to the SMTP server.
Prompt the user to enter the recipient’s email address, subject and body of the email.
Construct the email message with the provided data.
Send the email message.
Close the connection to the SMTP server.
Notify the user that the email was sent successfully.
In this project, we will be creating a Python script to automate the process of sending email to any given email address. The script will take the email address from a text file, read the information from the text file, and then use the Python smtplib module to send an email to the email address.

The script will need to use various functions such as the SMTP() function (to establish a secure connection to the email server), the sendmail() function (to actually send the email), and the quit() function (to close the connection). The user will need to provide the necessary information such as the email address and the subject line of the email, as well as the content of the email that they want to send.

This project is a great way to learn how to automate the sending of emails using Python. The project is also a great way to learn more about the smtplib module and how to use it in Python. Finally, the project is a great way to practice sending emails using a secure connection.
This project involves creating an automated email program for customers. The program will be able to send automated emails to customers with personalized messages.

The program should be able to take customer information from a database and generate customized emails based on the customer’s individual data. It should also be able to send out mass emails to a large group of customers.

The program should include features such as tracking email responses, scheduling emails to be sent at certain times, and creating filters so that certain emails are only sent to certain customers.

The program should also be able to track customer preferences and make recommendations to them on products and services.

The program should also be able to handle any errors and be able to recover from them, as well as handle any spam complaints.
The aim of this project is to develop a python script that automates the process of sending emails. The script should include the ability to customize the messages and include attachments. The script will also include features like sending the same message to multiple addresses, setting a specific time for the emails to be sent, and tracking the delivery status of the emails. It should also be able to read information from external sources, such as Excel files, to use in messages. The script should be able to integrate with popular email services like Gmail and Outlook, as well as other email services. The script should also include error handling, so that if an email fails to send for any reason, an error message is logged. The script should also be able to detect if an email address is invalid and notify the user accordingly.
