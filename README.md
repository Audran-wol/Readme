Developed an email automation script using Python to send personalized marketing emails to a list of subscribers.
Integrated the script with the Gmail API to send the emails, and used Beautiful Soup to scrape content from websites for each email.
Implemented error handling and logging to ensure the script runs smoothly and to debug issues when they arise.
Improved the performance of the script by using multithreading to send multiple emails simultaneously.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python, as well as my ability to integrate with external APIs and libraries.
This project involves creating an automated email program for customers. The program will be able to send automated emails to customers with personalized messages.

The program should be able to take customer information from a database and generate customized emails based on the customerâ€™s individual data. It should also be able to send out mass emails to a large group of customers.

The program should include features such as tracking email responses, scheduling emails to be sent at certain times, and creating filters so that certain emails are only sent to certain customers.

The program should also be able to track customer preferences and make recommendations to them on products and services.
The program triggers users to choose to receive the message via voice or video file transcription

The program should also be able to handle any errors and be able to recover from them, as well as handle any spam complaints.
The aim of this project is to develop a python script that automates the process of sending emails. The script should include the ability to customize the messages and include attachments. The script will also include features like sending the same message to multiple addresses, setting a specific time for the emails to be sent, and tracking the delivery status of the emails. It should also be able to read information from external sources, such as Excel files, to use in messages. The script should be able to integrate with popular email services like Gmail and Outlook, as well as other email services. The script should also include error handling, so that if an email fails to send for any reason, an error message is logged. The script should also be able to detect if an email address is invalid and notify the user accordingly.
This project automates the emailing process by setting up a python script. The script will allow you to set up a predetermined message and send it out automatically to a list of recipients. The script will use standard libraries such as smtplib and email to set up the message and send it out. It will also include a feature to track the email delivery status, as well as import contacts from a text file. The project is also built with security in mind by utilizing TLS encryption, so that your messages are completely secure. The project is also built to be easy to use, with a user-friendly interface.
